When creating a public-facing instance on Oracle Cloud, you need to ensure that your instance is accessible over the internet. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on the options you should select to make your instance publicly accessible:
1. Create a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)

    If you don't already have a VCN, you'll need to create one.
    Go to the Networking section and choose Virtual Cloud Networks.
    Create a new VCN with default settings, which will include an internet gateway.

2. Subnets

    When creating your instance, make sure you select a Public Subnet. A public subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to the internet gateway.
    This subnet should have a CIDR block that allows external traffic (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0).

3. Internet Gateway

    Ensure that the VCN has an Internet Gateway configured. This allows traffic to and from the internet.
    If your VCN doesn't have one, create it in the Networking section under Internet Gateways, then associate it with your VCN.

4. Security Lists

    Update the security list associated with your public subnet.
    Add an Ingress Rule to allow incoming traffic:
        Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0 (to allow traffic from any IP)
        Destination Port: Set this based on the service you're running (e.g., 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
    Ensure there's an Egress Rule that allows outgoing traffic:
        Destination CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
        Source Port: Any
        Destination Port: Any

5. Instance Configuration

    When configuring your instance:
        Shape: Choose the appropriate shape based on your needs.
        Networking: Select the VCN and the Public Subnet you set up earlier.
        Assign a Public IP Address: Ensure the option to assign a public IP is selected so that your instance is accessible from the internet.

6. Security Groups (Optional)

    Oracle Cloud allows for the use of Network Security Groups (NSGs) instead of or alongside Security Lists.
    If you're using NSGs, make sure to add appropriate ingress and egress rules to allow traffic similar to what you'd set in the Security Lists.

7. Firewall Configuration on the Instance

    Once the instance is up, configure the firewall on the instance itself (if applicable, such as iptables on Linux) to allow incoming traffic on the necessary ports.

8. Object Storage (Optional)

    If you're using object storage or other services that require public access, ensure the appropriate permissions are set to allow public access.

9. Testing

    After the instance is created, use the public IP address to access your instance remotely.
    Test the connection to ensure it is accessible over the internet using the service/port you intend to expose (e.g., SSH, HTTP, etc.).

By following these steps, you should be able to create an Oracle Cloud instance that is publicly accessible.
